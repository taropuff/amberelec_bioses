Complete archive of BIOSes for AmberELEC that match the hashes
it is looking for.

At least they matched on my RG351P running 351ELEC version
20211122 Pineapple Forest at the time of writing this README.

In case there are updates, I'll try and tag it to the same
AmberELEC version/date.

# Installation

Basically, just dump the entire *bios* content into the *bios*
folder on your SD Card.

The *neogeo* folder goes into the root of your SD Card.

# Verify

Open your AmberELEC settings and go to Game Settings ->
Missing BIOS Check (it's on the bottom of the menu). It should
say "No Missing BIOS Files".
