Complete archive of BIOSes for AmberELEC (and UnofficialOS)
that match the hashes it is looking for.

At least they matched on my RG351P running AmberELEC version
20230203 Panda Conspiracy at the time of writing/updating
this README.

In case there are updates, I'll try and tag it to the same
AmberELEC version/date.

# Installation

Basically, just dump the entire *bios* content into the *bios*
folder on your SD Card.

The *neogeo* folder goes into the root of your SD Card.

# Verify

Open your AmberELEC settings and go to Game Settings ->
Missing BIOS Check (it's on the bottom of the menu). It should
say "No Missing BIOS Files".
